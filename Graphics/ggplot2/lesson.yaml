- Class: text
  Output: "The ggplot2 package is a vast and powerful graphing package that is 
  implemented on top of the R statisical package. Created by Hadley Wickham in 
  2005, ggplot 2 has since become one of the most popular R packages."


- Class: text
  Output: "This lesson is designed to just scratch the surface of ggplot2 as an 
  introduction. We'll examine the simplest plot, qplot() for quick plot."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "This lesson has already loaded the ggplot2 package and the data set
  'mpg'."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "We will take a look at the mpg data set and use qplot() to generate a graphic.
  First, we need to know what is in the 'mpg' data set. Enter head(mpg)"
  CorrectAnswer: head(mpg)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(mpg)')
  
  
- Class: text
  Output: "The head() function is allowing us to see the first 6 rows of data and 
  the columns. Let's use this data to generate a graphic. "


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "First, take a look at the qplot() reference file. Type ?qplot to
  open the document."
  CorrectAnswer: ?qplot
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?qplot')

  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now let's take a look at a basic graph depicting the occurances of
  the different class types. Type qplot(x = mpg$class) "
  CorrectAnswer: qplot(x = mpg$class)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qplot(x = mpg$class)')

  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "As you can see we created a histogram for the different vehicle classes. What if
  we wanted to know the relation between highway mpg and the number of cylinders?
  Type qplot(x = mpg$hwy, y = mpg$cyl) "
  CorrectAnswer: qplot(x = mpg$hwy, y = mpg$cyl)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qplot(x = mpg$hwy, y = mpg$cyl)')
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "We can see that this creates a scatterplot. The graph generated uses the data$column 
  format for the x and y axis and this could be difficult to read. Let's rename these, type
  qplot(x = mpg$hwy, y = mpg$cyl, xlab = 'MPG', ylab = 'Cylinders')"
  CorrectAnswer: qplot(x = mpg$hwy, y = mpg$cyl, xlab = "MPG"", ylab = "Cylinders")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qplot(x = mpg$hwy, y = mpg$cyl, xlab = "MPG", ylab = "Cylinders")')

  Output: "Would you like to see a brief introductory video to ggplot2?"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What keyword would you use to add a title to a graph using qplot()?
  AnswerChoices: "head; main; title; top"
  CorrectAnswer: main
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='main')
  Hint: "use ?qplot for help"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now lets add a title to our previous graph called 'My Graph'" 
  CorrectAnswer: qplot(x = mpg$hwy, y = mpg$cyl, xlab = "MPG", ylab = "Cylinders", main = "My Graph")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qplot(x = mpg$hwy, y = mpg$cyl, xlab = "MPG", ylab = "Cylinders", main = "My Graph")')

  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "How could we change the size of the plots based on the vehicle's class?"
  AnswerChoices: "size = mpg$trans; shape = mpg$class; size = mpg$class; shape = mpg$cyl"
  CorrectAnswer: size = mpg$class
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='size = mpg$class')
  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Add to the graph so the plot point's size are based on the vehicle class"
  CorrectAnswer: qplot(x = mpg$hwy, y = mpg$cyl, xlab = "MPG", ylab = "Cylinders", main = "My Graph", size = mpg$class)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qplot(x = mpg$hwy, y = mpg$cyl, xlab = "MPG", ylab = "Cylinders", main = "My Graph", size = mpg$class)')
